    <h1>what is Git?</h1>
    <p>Git is a version control system developed by <b>Linus Torvalds</b> who also created Linux. <br>
    A version control system is a software tool that help to track and manage changes to files, code, documents, and any other types of digital content over time. <br>
    In software engineering, git helps to track and manage changes to code. <br>
    It is also used to collaborate in code by several software engineers. <br>
    other version control systems include;<ul>
        <li>mercurial(HG)</li>
        <li>Apache subversion(SVN)</li>
        <li>Performance Helix core</li>
        <li>Bazaar(BZR)</li>
    </ul>
    In this blog we will however be focusing on Git only.
    </p>
    <h1>How to install Git</h1>
    <p>
       For you to use Git you must first install it in your machine, or check if it has been installed. <br>
       open the command prompt/ terminal depending on the operating system you are using(windows,linux,macos). <br>
       Type the command <em>(git --verion)</em> and hit enter. <br>
       if you have Git installed then the response will be the version of Git installed in your machine eg.(git version 2.43.o.windows.1). <br>
       if not, then you will see an error message that the command is not recognized. <br>
       Go ahead and download Git. Here is a link <a href="https://ww.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank" title="download">Git</a>
    </p>
    <h1>Configuring Git</h1>
    <p>
        After installing Git let it know who you are by passing in your username and email address. <br>
        To configure your username use the command <em>(git config --global user.name"your username")</em> <br>
        To configure your email address use the command <em>(git config --user.email"your emailaddress")</em> <br>
        It is advisable that you use your GitHub email address. 
    </p>
    <h1>Initializing a Git repository</h1>
    <p>
        To use Git in your project, you need to initialize a git repository inside that project. <br>
        A git repository is a storage location where GIT version control system manages and stores projects files and revision history. <br>
        First check if the project contains a repository to avoid reinitializing by running the command <em>(git status)</em> <br>
        If the project does not contain a Git repository you will get the message "fatal not a git repository". <br>
        Any other message means that the project contains a repository. <br>
        If the project does not contain a git repository you can create/initialize one by using the command <em>(git init)</em> <br>
        you will see the text "initialized an empty git repository"if the repository is initialized successfully.
    </p>
    <h1>Adding files to the staging area </h1>
    <p>
        After creating an empty git repository, you need to add some files. <br>
        Use the command git status to verify that the file is part of the repository. <br>
        You will see that your file is under untracked files, thus you need to add it to your repository. <br>
        Files in your GitHub repository can be in one of the two states: tracked or untracked. <br>
        Tracked files: are files that git know about and are added to the repository. <br>
        Untracked files: this files are in the working directory they however avent been added to the repository. <br>
        A staging environment/area/index is an area where changes to files are prepared before they are committed to repository. <br>
        To add a file to the staging environment, use the command <em>(git add filename)</em> <br>
        If you have more than one file you can specify the file names <em>(git add file1 file2 file3)</em> <br>
        If you want to add all the files in the project instead of specifying those files, use a period symbol <em>(git add .)</em> <br>
    </p>
    <h1>Commiting changes</h1>
    <p>
      Adding commits keeps track of our progress changes as we work. <br>
      Git considers each commit change point or a save point, it is a point we can go back to in our project if we find a bug or we want to make a change. <br>
      We use the command <em>(git commit -m"commit message")</em> to commit changes to our repository. <br>
      The commit command performs a commit and the -m "message" adds a message. <br>
      To view past commits you use the command <em>(git log) or (git log --online)</em> if you want a bit more compressed output of git log.
    </p>
    <h1>Git branches</h1>
    <p>
        A branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.
        They allow multiple developers to work on differnet features, bug fixes, <br> or experiments simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. <br>
        when the work is complete, a branch can be merged into the main project
    </p>
    <h2>Creating a branch</h2>
    <p>To create a branch, we use the command <em>(git branch new-branch-name)</em>. <br>
        You can view all the branches we have using the command <em>(git branch)</em>. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Merging a branch</h2> <p>
            To merge a branch add all the changes made in the branch to the staging area then commit those changes. <br>
            After that move to your master/main branch?the branch you want to merge this branch with. <br>
            The master/main branch contains the latest, stable version of the codebase, where all finished and tested features are intergrated. <br>
            You use the command <em>(git merge branch-name)</em> to merge the branch.
</p>
<h3>Switching branches</h3>
<p>
You can change/switch branches using the command <em>(git checkout branch-name)</em> <br> </p>
<h3>Deleting brances</h3> 
<p>
    To delete a branch you use the command <em>(git btanch -D branch name)</em>
    </p>
